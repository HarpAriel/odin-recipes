        <h4>Have lasagna on the table in just 30 minutes with this simple skillet lasagna recipe.</h4>
        <p>Lasagna is delicious, but for most of us it's too time consuming for a weekday meal at the end of a busy day. With this version cooked on the stove top, you can have your lasanga - and eat it too!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>10 lasagna noodles, broken into 2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>28oz can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>8oz tomato sauce</li>
            <li>8 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>fresh basil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
             <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and saute the onions in the olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
             <li>Add the ground beef, and cook, breaking up chunks until the meat in no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
             <li>Sprinkle lasagna noodles evenly over the meat. Top with diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer for about 20 minutes, until noodles are tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. (The mixture will look watery after 15 minutes. If it looks dry, add 1/4 cup water.)</li>
             <li>Remove from the heat. Stir in parmesan cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Top with large spoonfuls of ricotta. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
             <li>Serve topped with fresh basil and grated parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
